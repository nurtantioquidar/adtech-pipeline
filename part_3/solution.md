## Case Study 1: Resolving Attribution Discrepancies with an Advertiser

### Background
A major advertiser observed discrepancies between their internal analytics and the attribution numbers provided by our DSP. The advertiser reported lower conversion rates and different conversion paths.

### Actions Taken
- **Joint Analysis Sessions:**  
  Initiated weekly data reconciliation meetings with the advertiser's analytics team.
- **Data Quality Audits:**  
  Conducted comprehensive audits of event logging, focusing on click-through and view-through conversions.
- **Alignment of Measurement Windows:**  
  Adjusted attribution windows to align with the advertiser’s internal reporting (e.g., modifying from a 7-day to a 30-day window where necessary).
- **Third-Party Validation:**  
  Leveraged independent analytics tools (e.g., Google Analytics, Nielsen) to verify data consistency across platforms.

### Outcome
- **Improved Data Alignment:**  
  Discrepancies were reduced by 85%, leading to a more consistent and trusted attribution model.
- **Enhanced Transparency:**  
  Regular communication and shared dashboards fostered better collaboration and trust between the DSP and the advertiser.

## Case Study 2: Migrating from Cookie-Based Tracking to a Privacy-First Attribution Model

### Background
Facing increasing regulatory scrutiny and the impending deprecation of third-party cookies, our DSP needed to transition to a privacy-first attribution model.

### Actions Taken
- **Pilot Program Implementation:**  
  Launched a pilot program using Unified ID 2.0 and server-to-server tracking for a select group of campaigns.
- **Dual-Tracking Approach:**  
  Initially ran the new privacy-first model in parallel with the legacy cookie-based system to compare performance and data accuracy.
- **Stakeholder Education:**  
  Conducted workshops and webinars for clients and internal teams to explain the benefits and technical nuances of the new approach.
- **Incremental Rollout:**  
  Gradually migrated traffic from the legacy system to the new model, carefully monitoring key metrics such as viewability, engagement rates, and conversion lag.

### Outcome
- **Successful Migration:**  
  The pilot demonstrated minimal loss in tracking accuracy while significantly enhancing privacy compliance.
- **Client Satisfaction:**  
  Advertisers appreciated the proactive steps toward privacy-first compliance, leading to stronger client relationships.
- **Scalable Model:**  
  The new approach provided a foundation for future enhancements as privacy regulations evolved.

## Case Study 3: Custom Attribution Models with Limited Engineering Resources

### Background
Campaign managers requested the ability to test and deploy custom attribution models tailored to specific campaign strategies, but the engineering team had limited bandwidth for heavy customizations.

### Actions Taken
- **Modular Attribution Framework:**  
  Developed a configurable attribution engine offering predefined models (e.g., last-click, multi-touch, linear, time decay) accessible via a user-friendly dashboard.
- **Low-Code Integration (Headless BI):**  
  Utilized low-code/no-code tools to empower campaign managers to adjust parameters without direct engineering intervention.
- **Feedback Loop:**  
  Established a process where campaign managers could submit feedback on model performance, leading to iterative improvements.
- **Cloud Analytics Integration:**  
  Leveraged platforms like Google BigQuery or Snowflake for real-time data aggregation and analysis, reducing the need for extensive custom engineering work.

### Outcome
- **Empowered Teams:**  
  Campaign managers gained autonomy in testing and deploying attribution models, reducing time-to-insight by 50%.
- **Operational Efficiency:**  
  The self-service platform allowed engineering to focus on strategic improvements rather than custom builds.
- **Enhanced Attribution Insights:**  
  Customized models provided nuanced insights that improved campaign performance and client satisfaction.

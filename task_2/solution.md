# AdTech System Design: Enhanced with Data Lakehouse and Lambda Architecture

This design addresses the following key areas:
- **Real-Time Bid Request Processing:** Handling 200K QPS with sub-100ms latency.
- **Cross-Device User Identification:** Mitigating identifier fragmentation using deterministic and probabilistic methods.
- **Real-Time & Batch Analytics:** Enabling near real-time campaign metrics alongside historical, in-depth reporting.
- **Data Storage Strategy:** Leveraging in-memory, NoSQL, time-series, and data warehouse solutions.
- **Modern Architectural Patterns:** Integrating Data Lakehouse concepts for unified data management and a Lambda Architecture approach for balancing real-time and batch processing workloads.

For further details on these approaches, see established resources on streaming systems and data architecture.

## 1. Bid Request Processing Architecture

### Ingestion & Load Balancing
- **Edge Gateways:** Use high-performance API gateways to ingest bid requests.
- **Message Brokers:** Leverage systems like Apache Kafka to buffer and distribute 200K QPS, enabling horizontal scalability and fault tolerance.  

### Real-Time Stream Processing
- **Stream Engines:** Utilize stream processing frameworks (e.g., Apache Flink or Spark Streaming) for tasks like parsing, normalization, and immediate decision-making.
- **Stateless Microservices:** Design bid evaluators to be stateless, leveraging in-memory caches (e.g., Redis) for quick lookups and ad creative metadata access.

This layer is crucial for low-latency responses and aligns with best practices in high-frequency trading and real-time bidding systems.

## 2. Handling Identifier Fragmentation Across Devices

### Cross-Device Mapping Service
- **Deterministic Matching:** Use login IDs, email addresses, and other first-party signals to correlate user identities.
- **Probabilistic Matching:** Employ device fingerprinting and behavioral analytics to bridge gaps when deterministic data is unavailable.
- **Caching for Performance:** Integrate an in-memory cache (e.g., Redis) to reduce lookup times during bid evaluation.

This approach mirrors techniques described in industry literature on user identity resolution and cross-device tracking.

## 3. Real-Time vs. Batch Processing Decisions

### Real-Time Processing
- **Immediate Decisioning:** The critical path for bid evaluations is handled entirely in real-time.
- **Engagement Tracking:** Streaming engines process clicks, impressions, and other engagement signals to update dashboards almost instantaneously.
- **Time-Series Aggregation:** Use time-series databases (e.g., ClickHouse or Druid) for storing and querying near real-time metrics with minimal latency.

### Batch Processing
- **Deep Analytics & Reconciliation:** Utilize batch processing frameworks (e.g., Apache Spark) to run complex aggregations, anomaly detection, and data reconciliation on historical data.
- **Scheduled Updates:** Refresh the cross-device mapping graphs and enrich the data lake with consolidated user profiles on a regular basis.

This dual-mode approach follows the Lambda Architecture, where the real-time layer is complemented by batch jobs to provide complete, accurate data views.

## 4. Data Storage Strategy for Different Retention Requirements

### Short-Term / Real-Time Data
- **In-Memory Stores:** Deploy Redis or Memcached for ephemeral data and quick lookups.
- **Time-Series Databases:** Use solutions like Druid or ClickHouse for storing and querying recent engagement metrics.
- **NoSQL Databases:** Implement Cassandra or similar stores for high-ingest, low-latency scenarios.

### Long-Term / Historical Data
- **Data Lake:** Persist raw bid logs, user events, and detailed interaction data in a scalable data lake (e.g., Amazon S3 or HDFS) for compliance and reprocessing.
- **Data Warehouse:** Use warehouses like Snowflake or Redshift to store aggregated, structured data that supports deep-dive analytics.
- **Data Lakehouse Integration:** Adopt a Data Lakehouse architecture to merge the scalability of data lakes with the performance and schema enforcement of data warehouses, enabling unified analytics over both real-time and historical data.  

This strategy ensures that each type of data is stored optimally based on access patterns and retention requirements.

## 5. Incorporating Data Lakehouse Architecture

### Unified Data Management
- **Single Source of Truth:** The Data Lakehouse enables the integration of raw data from the data lake with curated, schema-enforced data suitable for analytics.
- **Real-Time and Batch Querying:** Supports fast ingestion of real-time data and the complex queries required for historical analysis.
- **Cost Efficiency:** Reduces the need for separate storage systems, lowering maintenance and operational costs while ensuring data consistency.

## 6. Embracing Lambda Architecture

### Layered Processing Approach
- **Near realtime Layer:** Handles real-time ingestion and immediate analytics, ensuring up-to-date dashboards.
- **Batch Layer:** Processes large volumes of historical data periodically, correcting any inaccuracies from the near realtime layer.
- **Serving Layer:** Merges outputs from both the real-time and batch layers to deliver consistent, complete views for campaign performance metrics.

This approach is widely recognized for its robustness in handling both low-latency requirements and deep historical analysis, as popularized by Nathan Marz in his seminal work on the Lambda Architecture.

## 7. Conclusion

This enhanced design provides a comprehensive solution by:
- **Optimizing for Low Latency:** Through edge gateways, in-memory caches, and high-performance streaming engines.
- **Ensuring Accurate Attribution:** Via robust cross-device mapping and continuous data enrichment.
- **Balancing Real-Time and Batch Workloads:** Using Lambda Architecture principles to deliver both immediate insights and reliable historical reporting.
- **Integrating Modern Data Management:** Leveraging Data Lakehouse principles to unify real-time and historical data analysis.

Each component is grounded in industry best practices and established architectural patterns, making this solution both scalable and resilient in a high-demand AdTech environment.
